Administration Building,1,,1912,"Originally the Manitoba Agricultural College when it was built in 1912, it is now the Administration Building. Its central location and strong visual lines make it the focus of the campus. Photos and drawings of the building are often used to represent the whole university. The unique cross-plan staircase inside is a striking feature."
Engineering and Information Technology Complex,2,,,"The large three building complex is separated from University Centre by a large open area between the buildings that is a popular meeting and lunch area in summer. The red brick section (Engineering 1) is one of the original campus buildings. Engineering 2, facing the Duckworth Quadrangle, opened just in time for Fall 2005 classes to begin. Each building is named after former deans; E. P. Fetherstonhaugh, A. E. Macdonald, and Jack Hoogstraten."
Aboriginal House,3,,,"The centre will help the University of Manitoba achieve one of its key priorities which is to increase Aboriginal participation in undergraduate, graduate and professional programs. 

Representatives of the Aboriginal community on campus and selected award-winning Prairie Architects designed the centre. Four of the key members of Prairie Architects' design team are Aboriginal, and have graduated or are completing their studies at the University of Manitoba in Architecture or Interior Design.

Some of the elements in the building (approx. 15,000 square feet & targeted for LEED certification) include a meeting space, circle room for ceremonies, student lounge, computer lab, kitchen, and administrative offices for:

Aboriginal Student Centre with Elders-in-Residence
Aboriginal Student Association
