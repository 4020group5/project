# Specification

Impementing a context-aware system.

Your project consists of building a context-aware application for allowing visitors access to information on the UofM campus. A context-aware application typically 'pushes' information to the user based on their location. You need to (A) implement the most important tasks you identified during the prototype phase, in assignment #3. Along with those, you need to (B) build your application to handle the following tasks:
- Ability to see buildings in proximity to current location.
- Ability to obtain information about such buildings, such as who built it, when it was built, what departments exist in the building and any other supplementary information that you are able to provide about the building.
- Ability to see a map with dots showing each building in your database.
- Ability to search for specific departments and having the display show the search criteria on the map.

Finally, you need to (C) implement a solution you have identified for one of the following mobile UI challenges:
- Input occlusion ('fat-finger')
- Limited display

End-user testing:    
You should ask 2-3 users to use your application before submitting it. In particular you should ensure that your solution to either challenge, 'finger occlusion' or 'limited display' works properly.

Demo:    
As with A2 and A3, you will need to demo your project outcomes to the TA.
